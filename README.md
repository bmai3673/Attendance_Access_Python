Attendance_Access_Python
========================

This code is meant to read a CSV file and allow the user to select the desired information from the CSV. The most important files are the CSV file and the file that is called "csvreader.py" which contains all of the code. Disregard the sort files, they are rather irrelevant to the project and do not affect the main code. The code for this project was written using Python 2.7.
